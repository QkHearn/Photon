  <b>"Reasoning through light, coding through logic."</b><br>
  Photon is more than just an AI assistant; it is a <b>high-performance, engineering-grade self-evolving agent core</b> built natively in C++.<br>
  It gives AI real "hands" and "brains," redefining the AI-driven software development paradigm with microsecond response speeds, deep reasoning, and a multi-dimensional perception system.

## 📦 Quick Start

1.  **Download**: Extract binary artifacts from [Releases](https://github.com/hearn/Photon/releases).
2.  **Configure**: Set API keys and model parameters in `config.json`.
3.  **Launch**:
    ```bash
    ./photon <your_project_path>
    ```

## 🌟 Core Evolutions

### 🧠 Cognitive Reasoning
Photon rejects "intuitive responses." Faced with complex engineering challenges, it automatically opens a **Sequential Thinking** canvas for multi-stage hypothesis building, logical deduction, and strategy refinement. Like a senior engineer, it polishes solutions in its "brain" to ensure every execution is rigorous and feasible.

### 🏎️ Native Velocity
Say goodbye to the slowness of interpreted languages. Built with **pure C++17**, Photon's toolchain calls achieve **microsecond** response times:
*   **Zero-second startup**: Binary programs enter combat mode instantly.
*   **Parallel scanning**: Faster content localization than traditional IDEs, scanning tens of thousands of lines of code in milliseconds to pinpoint context.

### 🧩 Skill Modules
Photon introduces an advanced **Skill Modular Architecture**. It's not just a collection of tools, but **pluggable capabilities**.
*   **Skill Manager**: Dynamically loads specialized domain knowledge packages (e.g., `skill-creator`), instantly transforming a general AI into a domain-specific expert.
*   **Local Synchronization**: Automatically syncs global skills to the project local directory, supporting project-level capability customization and isolation.

### 👁️ Architecture Perception
Photon has perception beyond text. It can instantly deconstruct complex projects via **AST analysis** and use **Graphviz** to render abstract code logic into **visual architecture diagrams** in real-time.

### 🕸️ Universal MCP
Through the standard **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Photon connects to the entire modern ecosystem:
*   **Browser Hegemony**: Perfect integration with Puppeteer, giving AI the power to directly take over Chrome (reading docs, debugging pages, automated workflows).
*   **Dual-domain Computation**: Combines the stable execution of C++ with the flexible computation of a Python Sandbox to cover all scenarios.

## 🔬 The Arsenal

Photon comes pre-installed with **20+** heavy engineering tools, forming a complete perception-decision-execution loop:

### 📂 Holographic File Perception
*   **file_search / grep_search**: Git-first parallel retrieval to lock onto code snippets.
*   **read_file_lines**: Intelligent slice reading to get deep details while protecting the token window.
*   **code_ast_analyze**: Skeleton perception to understand project structure without wasting tokens.

### 🛠️ Atomic Refactoring & Execution
*   **diff_apply**: Deterministic code injection ensuring zero redundancy during refactoring.
*   **python_sandbox**: Automatically identifies `.venv` environments, supporting instant dependency installation and computation.
*   **arch_visualize**: One-click conversion of code logic into architecture diagrams.
*   **skill_read**: Dynamically reads skill guides to load specialized knowledge on demand.

### 🌍 Global Knowledge Retrieval
*   **web_search / web_fetch**: Automated information collection to provide the purest real-time corpus for AI.
*   **harmony_search**: Deep integration with the HarmonyOS developer ecosystem for second-level core documentation access.

### 💾 Cross-session Persistent Memory
*   **memory_management**: Records project standards and historical lessons; Photon grows to understand your habits better over time.

## 🛡️ Photon Guard

**Photon Guard** monitors all low-level calls in real-time to ensure the agent operates within safe boundaries:
*   **Path Locking**: Strictly prohibits path escape, restricting permissions to the current workspace.
*   **Danger Perception**: Real-time blocking of destructive commands like `rm -rf` and `sudo`.
*   **Isolated Execution**: Mandatory interception of sensitive system operations.
