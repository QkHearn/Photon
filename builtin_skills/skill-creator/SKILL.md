# Skill: Photon Skill Author
Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Photon's capabilities. Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources.

## Core Principles
1. **Concise is Key**: Only add context Photon doesn't already have.
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Put essential information in SKILL.md; move details to separate files.
